##### SCHEMA GUIDELINES
## Naming Conventions
# Certain prefixes may be used to indicate a particular type of value.
#   * total - indicates this is a cumulative value (e.g. totalSharesMinted, totalGrossReturns)
#   * balance - indicates this is a spot balance (e.g. balanceTokensInvested, balanceTokensIdle)
# Use plurals when referring to Tokens or Shares (e.g. totalShares, balanceTokens)
